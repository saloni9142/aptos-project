## Vision

The **JobReferralPlatform** smart contract creates a decentralized referral system, enabling employers to reward individuals who successfully refer candidates for job positions. This platform ensures transparency and fairness in managing referral payments, allowing for easy tracking and automatic payments upon hire confirmation.

## Features

- **Create Job Referral**:
  - Referrers can create job referrals, specifying a referral fee that will be paid upon a successful hire.
- **Confirm Hire & Pay Referral Fee**:
  - Once a candidate is hired, the employer can confirm the hire, triggering the payment of the referral fee to the referrer.

## Future Scope

1. **Referral Tracking**:

   - Implement tracking for multiple referrals, allowing referrers to manage and monitor the progress of their referrals.

2. **Multi-Stage Payment**:

   - Add support for multi-stage payments, where part of the referral fee is paid upfront and the rest after a probation period.

3. **Automated Candidate Verification**:
   - Integrate an automated system for verifying whether the referred candidate has been hired, reducing the need for manual confirmations.

The **JobReferralPlatform** contract offers a decentralized solution to incentivize job referrals, ensuring transparency and efficiency in managing referral rewards.
